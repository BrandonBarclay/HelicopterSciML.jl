# Hybrid Helicopter Model

This is a repository for the helicopter SciML challenge problem. The
problem is centered on automatically discovering physically-realistic
augmentations to a model of a laboratory helicopter to better predict
the movement. This problem is hard because it is realistic:

- We do not have data from every single detail about the helicopter.
  We know the electrical signals that are being sent to the rotories
  and we know the measurements of yaw and pitch angles, but there are
  many hidden variables that are not able to be measured.
- While it is govered by physical first principles, these first principles
  do not describe the whole system. 
- Since our goal is to understand the helicopter system, simply training
  a neural network or performing reinforcement learning does not solve the
  problem: we wish to understand the acutal physics instead of simply making
  predictions.

**The goal of this challenge is to utilize automated tools to discover a
physcially-explainable model that accurately predicts the dynamics of the
system**

## Initial Results

The first principle physics model makes fairly good predictions for the evolution
of the pitch angle but does is not a great predictor of the yaw angle:

Initial attempts at automated discovery at the missing physical equations
utilized [universal differential equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04385)
to discover missing friction terms in ths torque:

The model with this automatically discovered terms has an improved fit to the yaw angle:

## Goals of the Challenge

The challenge is multi-faceted and there is no single number to determine
whether one has done well. However, the features of a solution which
are beneficial are:

- Predictive: Indicators of fit are given by the predicted pitch and
  yaw angles.
- Conservative: the new model is closely based in kind or structure
  to the original mechanistic model. If a very small changes causes
  a very large benefit, this is seen as advantageous to a change that
  throws out the mechanism entirely but receives good predictions.
- Physical: the new model should be able to mechanistically justify
  the terms that are added. Unphysical terms are deemed not desirable
  even if they add to the predictiveness of the model.
- Extrapolatory: Models trained on a subset of the time that can
  extrapolate to future times are deemed advantageous to models that
  utilize the full data.
- Validatable: Models that generate hypotheses that can be independently
  validated are deemed advantageous to models that are a blackbox
  and can only be validated by the exact time series data that is
  used for training/testing.
  
## Detailed Description of the Challenge Problem

A detailed description of the challenge problem can be found in the
[challenge problem write-up](https://github.com/ChrisRackauckas/HelicopterSciML.jl/blob/master/papers/Hybrid_Helicopter_model.pdf)
which explains the derivation of the helicpter model, the data source,
the current fits, and the current experiments in automated physical
augmentation discovery.

## Starter Code

The scripts, stored in `/scripts`, are as follows:

- Helicopter.jl: the initial global optimization performed using the
  basic physical equations.
- neural_attempts.jl: the attempted neural augmentation strategies.
  In `_u` the approach is making K nonlinear in u(t), and `_ux`
  allows for the addition of new state-dependent terms. Additionally,
  fourier_attempt showcases using the Fourier basis for learning a
  similar universal approximator.
- equation_discovery.jl: the sparsification of the discovered neural
  neural network. Results in the determination of new physical equations
  and a plot of the accuracy. `_u` is for a version that only is trained
  to add terms based on u(t), while `_ux` allows state-dependent terms
  to be discovered.

The other folders are:

- data: the original data
- figs: the figures generated by the scripts
- optimization_results: the values generated by the scripts, like
  trained neural network parameters and discovered equations
- papers: the work in progress draft

At the top level there is a Project.toml and Manifest.toml for
reproducibility.
